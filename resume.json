    "summary": "I’ve been coding since I was 11.  I’m very lazy, so I make computers do my job so I won’t have to.  I’m obsessed with software quality.  I make software scale.  I’ll do functional programming in C, imperative programming in Haskell and logic programming in SQL if it's the right solution.  I love teaching.  I strongly believe empathy is a core engineering value.",
